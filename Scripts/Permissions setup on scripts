SSM Role role created for S3FullAccess attaching to EC2 for copyinng file to S3 befre last step in Script1

Identified commands cannot run remotely on ec2 console, hence edited SSM role adding AmazonSSMMnagedInstanceCore policy and started SSM agent on ec2 before proceeding with script2

To run commands from AWS CLI on EC2 installed session manager plugin on terminal and added a customized policy for SSM Role and Jenkins User and Jenkins Group as below
